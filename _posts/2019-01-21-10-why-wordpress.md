**Creating a website can be troublesome as its difficult to know where to start!**

You'll be introduced to a plethra of options and solutions, all with their different kits and tools which will determine the end result of your website.

Shopify, Wix and Squarespace all try to make it easy for people to create websites within minutes but sometimes you need more power behind your website!

With Wordpress you'll be able to do add more punch to your website, allowing you to get more technical with the features and functions you would like to integrate.

## Wordpress is just for blogs?

One of the common misconceptions about WordPress is that it’s mainly for building blogs. At one point in time that was, in fact, the case. 

WordPress was developed as a blogging platform, but that has changed drastically with the various new releases over the years.

In fact, WordPress is at an advantage due to its blogging roots. It’s by far one of the cleanest, fastest ways to write and publish blog posts, and that’s all included right from the start.

Some website building tools think about design and apps first, then the blogging interface comes in as an afterthought.

That’s not the case with WordPress, so you can create a beautiful ecommerce site and know that the blog is an integral part of the development process.

Wordpress can basically do, anything!
